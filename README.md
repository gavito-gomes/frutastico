# Frutástico

## What it is
Frutástico is a branding for a fictional drink powder company. 

This project was developed in the web design and image synthesis classes, on the graphic computation course of IFPE (Federal Institute of Pernambuco).

## The branding

The idea for the branding came of the combination of the words "fruit" and "fantastic" (something like fruitastic), making it friendly and funny. The idea was to create a illustrations based visual identity for the packaging in a overall colorful and fun environment.

## The website

One of the proposed challenges was to applicate the  branding in a website, and make it presentable and usable.

The website has the following structure:

* **Home**

    - The initial page, where there are some offers and advertisements

* **Products**

    - An area where the customers can see some products, its flavors and ingredients.

* **Recipes**

    - A page to read some recipes that use the drink powders as an ingredient.

* **Community**

    - The page where the company can engage the community, proposing challenges and special events.

* **About us**

    - The history of the company.

* **Contact us**

    - A contact form that is a way to the users interact with the company
